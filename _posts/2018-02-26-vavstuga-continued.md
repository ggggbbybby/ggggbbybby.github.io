Hello! It's been awhile! The warp preview tool has a home now at [vavstuga.design](http://vavstuga.design). Notable new features: creating new patterns! If you sign up you get all the CRUD fun you've come to expect from weekend rails apps, I think if you go in as a guest you can only play with existing patterns.

Features are still getting added as I think of them, but here's what I'm still working on:
 * more yarn types & a colorway editor
 * thumbnail editing for thumbnails that don't tile quite as beautifully
 * a "buy this" button to export your design to the vavstuga shopping cart
