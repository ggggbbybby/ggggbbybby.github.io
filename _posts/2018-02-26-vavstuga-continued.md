Hello! It's been awhile! The warp preview tool has a home now at [vavstuga.design](http://vavstuga.design). Signing in as a user lets you create and edit your own patterns, but you can preview any of the existing designs as guest.

Features are still getting added as I think of them, but here's what I'm still working on:
 * more yarn types & a colorway editor
 * thumbnail editing for thumbnails that don't tile quite as beautifully
 * a "buy this" button to export your design to the vavstuga shopping cart
 * tooltips/documentation for using the pattern editor
