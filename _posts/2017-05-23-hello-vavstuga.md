Hello from beautiful Shelburne Falls! Today was the first day of class here at the weaving studio, we all threaded our looms and planned out our projects. The warp planner has been very popular, and on friday we're talking about where it goes next. I'm very excited about that.

Here's what's on my loom:

and here's what's going on with the warp planner! I've made a few more improvements -- I replaced the drag&drop with clicks, to make it easier to use, and now you can click on the stripes themselves to add color! [You can play with it here!](/vavstuga-stripes)
